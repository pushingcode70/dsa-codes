//stack using linked list
//The new keyword in C++ dynamically allocates memory on the heap and returns the address of that memory. 
//You then usually store this address in a pointer.
//new will alocate the varibale address on heap and by doing int*y=&x will allocate on stack
//for the object to access the data member in case of dynamic allocation we need "->" to access it 
//linked list the node stores the data of the first varibale and contain the memory address of second vaiable
//he -> operator is used to access members (data or functions) of an object through a pointer.
